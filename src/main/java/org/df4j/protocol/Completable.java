     * be invoked concurrently by multiple threads in an overlapping fashion and the invocation pattern must
     * adhere to the following protocol:
     * <pre><code>    onSubscribe (onError | onComplete)?</code></pre>

     * Subscribing a {@code CompletableObserver} to multiple {@code CompletableSource}s is not recommended. If such reuse
     * happens, it is the duty of the {@code CompletableObserver} implementation to be ready to receive multiple calls to
     * its methods and ensure proper concurrent behavior of its business logic.
     * <p>
     * The implementations of the {@code onXXX} methods should avoid throwing runtime exceptions other than the following cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the argument is {@code null}, the methods can throw a {@code NullPointerException}.
     * Note though that RxJava prevents {@code null}s to enter into the flow and thus there is generally no
     * need to check for nulls in flows assembled from standard sources and intermediate operators.
     * </li>
     * <li>If there is a fatal error (such as {@code VirtualMachineError}).</li>
     * </ul>
