/**
 * {@link AsyncProc} is the base class of all active components of {@link Dataflow} graph.
 * Used in this basic form, it allows to construct asynchronous procedure calls.
 * {@link AsyncProc} contains single predefined port to accept flow of control by call to the method {@link AsyncProc#start()}.\
 * As a {@link Node}, it is descendand of {@link org.df4j.core.communicator.Completion} class, which allows to monitor execution
 * of this asynchonous procedure both with synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.
 * {@link AsyncProc} usually contains contain additional input and output ports to exchange messages and signals with
 * other {@link AsyncProc}s in consistent manner.
 * The lifecycle of any  {@link AsyncProc} is as follows:
 * {@link ActorState#Created} &ge; {@link ActorState#Blocked} &ge; {@link ActorState#Running} &ge; {@link ActorState#Completed}.
 * It moves to {@link ActorState#Blocked} as a result of invocation of {@link AsyncProc#start()} method.
 * It becomes  {@link ActorState#Running} and is submitted for execution to its executor when all ports become ready.
 * It becomes {@link ActorState#Completed} when its method {@link AsyncProc#runAction()} completes, normally or exceptionally.
